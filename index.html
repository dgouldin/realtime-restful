                  care about data flow, not causality.</li>

                <li>a parent view receives events from a store (explanation

                <li>practically speaking, you can think of it as your REST API

                <li>this is part of what makes flux such a natural fit for our

                <li>Actions may be called in response to a view's event handler.

            <aside class="notes">
              <ul>
                <li>"X happened" is actually shorthand for "A, B, and C objects
                have been mutated".</li>
                <li>If instead of events, we simply enumerated all state
                  mutations (including Nth degrees like aggregates), the event
                  itself would be useless.</li>
                <li>The reason we tend to think in terms of events is because it
                  makes more sense to our causal-driven brains. Computers
                  don't care about causality.</li>
                <li>This creates an implicit contract based on derivation of
                  cause-effect relationships in our code. That's why it's so
                  difficult to understand, maintain, and untangle!</li>

              <ul>
                <li>If we agree that state change is what we're targeting, all
                  we need is a way to know about all operations which change
                  state.</li>
                <li>Once we isolate mutation of data, we have the all the
                  hooks necessary to enumerate mutations explicitly.</li>
                <li>Our streaming contract can then become both comprehensible and
                  maintainable.</li>
                <li>No more spooky action at a distance where the name of an
                  event type means any number of side-effects to our client
